My Portfolio

This is a portfolio to display my work throught this first year in Noroff

My portfolio layout is pretty straight forward. I didnt want to try anything outside of my knowledge so i went for something i knew how to do. The home page consists of two main "heroÂ´s" one with info about me and some contact info and the second one with three of my projects that i have been working on throughout this last year.There is also a contact page where you are able to write longer messages.
